# 📱 QuickNotes — Android Notes App (Java)

**QuickNotes** is a lightweight and minimalistic Android app built with **Java** and **XML layouts**.  
It was developed as a practice project to strengthen core Android fundamentals:  
Activities, layouts, RecyclerView, and local data persistence.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of my Android learning path within the **DAM program**.  
It focuses on understanding the **native Android architecture**, clean UI design,  
and efficient state handling without external dependencies.

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Goals

- Understand the **Android project structure** (`manifests`, `java`, `res`, Gradle).
- Design responsive interfaces using **XML layouts**.
- Manage **Activity lifecycle** and user interactions.
- Display dynamic lists with **RecyclerView** and custom adapters.
- Implement **local data storage** (SharedPreferences, later Room).
- Practice **version control** and project documentation on GitHub.
